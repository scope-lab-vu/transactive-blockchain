Important Files: 

~/python/fab/fabfile.py			Fabric file that contains python methods 
					that can be targetted to specific hosts 

~/python/fab/network-config.json	Configuration JSON for network to setup

~/python/fab/config-clients.py		Script to read in config file and to 
					send the proper 'configuration' to each
					host (for 'peers' and 'miners' right now)

Edit network-config.json to have the desired configuration you want.

several assumptions built into the config right now, Such as:

1. only 1 DSO node
2. only 1 Miner node
3. host-names are in [ ~/.ssh/config ] with appropriate private SSH keys/IPs/etc.
4. bootstrap-node data isn't yet used. This needs to be fixed.

When finished the command [ ./config-clients.py ] will setup the network with 
the appropriate settings from the json config file.

How to setup a contract: Any node in the network is (should) be able to to create a new
contract and be able to 'deploy' it to the network. Note: No 'update' to contracts exists.
Therefore contracts would need to be deleted and then a new one deployed.
