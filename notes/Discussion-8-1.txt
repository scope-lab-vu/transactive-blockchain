Geth Clients
============

- DSO (acts as the mixing services)
- Prosumer (petra)
   - generates the anonymous address by itself. they have to generate a number of addresses at different times.
   - Requests from the DSO (Request/Reply with a timeout - High). This can be done any time. No urgency at anytime.
   - DSO must validate the prosumer. (out of band- riaps)/ keys will be setup during. (ZeroMQ based setup)
   - DSO will transfer ether.
   - Prosumer will listen for the broadcast event.
Describe how prosumer can hide from the DSO if it wants? 
- why we don't need mixing service. But generate keys enough.
- we need to keep track of ether to address the computation workload imbalances.
- There has to be a cost for posting and rescinding offers.
- We should have the ability accept partial power offers.
- We should say that we have though about the inconsistency of power distribution.
- Miner (at least 1)


Rdiscovery

Smart Meter
