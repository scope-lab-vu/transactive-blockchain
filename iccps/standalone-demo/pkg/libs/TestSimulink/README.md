This folder contains a RIAPS application "TestSimulink". It consists of a "PubSim" component that sennds values on a publish port. Another component, called "SubSim", subscribes on the topic and receives the values. It then calls a Simulink fuction with the value as an argument and then logs the output returned. The ctypes module is used to integrated RIAPS python code with the c code generated by Simulink.
