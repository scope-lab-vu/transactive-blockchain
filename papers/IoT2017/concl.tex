\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:concl}

As the complexity of power systems increases due to the evolution of power grids, decentralized transactive-energy IoT systems are emerging to tackle this complexity.
However, these decentralized systems also give rise to new privacy challenges, which are further complicated by the stringent safety and security requirements of power systems.
We have addressed these challenges by providing a novel solution for anonymous energy trading within a transactive microgrid.
Our solution builds on distributed ledgers, such as blockchains, and other proven techniques for anonymity, such as mixing services and onion routing.
We have described the novel process of anonymous energy trading and detailed the novel transactions and services used in our system.
Finally, we have discussed how the proposed solution satisfies security, safety, and privacy requirements.
In future work, we will provide rigorous proofs of satisfying these requirements, and we will present an implementation of our system with performance results.
