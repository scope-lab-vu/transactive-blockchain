\begin{abstract}
Power grids are undergoing major changes due to rapid growth in renewable energy resources and improvements in battery technology.
While these changes enhance sustainability and efficiency, they also create significant management challenges as the complexity of power systems increases.
To tackle these challenges, decentralized solutions are emerging, which arrange local communities into microgrids.
Within a transactive microgrid, consumers with energy generation and storage capabilities may trade energy with each other, thereby smoothing the load on the main grid using local supply.
However, providing security, safety, and privacy in a decentralized and transactive energy system is very challenging.
On the one hand, consumers' personal information must be protected from their their trade partners and the system operator.
On the other hand, the system must be protected from careless or malicious trading, which could destabilize the entire grid. 
In this paper, we design a secure and safe solution for transactive microgrids, which enables consumers to trade energy without sacrificing their privacy.
Our solution builds on distributed ledgers, such as blockchains, and provides anonymity for communication, bidding, and trading.

\section{Analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}

Here, we present a semi-formal analysis of the proposed solution, and show that it satisfies the security, safety, and privacy requirements.

\subsection{Security}

\subsection{Safety}

\subsection{Privacy}

Due to the communication anonymity and mixing services, members of a microgrid can see only the amount of energy and financial assets withdrawn by a prosumer.
Since all trading transactions are anonymous, the amount of assets traded by the prosumer will not be publicly known.
In case a prosumer does not wish to trade, it can anonymously deposit its assets to a random address that was freshly generated by its smart meter.
Note that even if a prosumer does not wish to trade, it should always withdraw and mix assets; otherwise, the lack of withdrawal would leak information.

As for the DSO, it can receive the same information from the smart meter as in a non-transactive grid (i.e., amount of energy produced and consumed).
\todo{Also knows financial amounts, but those are necessary for billing.}
Since trading is anonymous, it does not receive any further information.

In fact, we can provide an even higher-level of privacy.
Since price policies are recorded on the ledger, which the smart meters may read, the smart meters can calculate the prosumer's monthly bill, and send only this single financial amount to the DSO each month.
Meanwhile, the DSO can still obtain current and future load information from the bid storage and from the trades recorded on the ledger.
