\section{Introduction}

% electric grid is changing: renewables, storage capacity, etc. -> prosumers

In order to take advantage of these capabilities, electric grids need to become more decentralized.
% what are the advantages of decentralization?

% transactive microgrid

% there are pilot studies, however, providing privacy is an open problem
For example, the Brooklyn Microgrid developed by LO3 Energy is a peer-to-peer energy market for locally generated renewable energy.\footnote{\url{http://brooklynmicrogrid.com/}}

Transactive energy may pose a much greater threat to prosumers' privacy than smart metering.
\begin{itemize}
\item Firstly, since prosumers may purchase energy from each other in a transactive microgrid, transactions may inadvertently reveal the prosumers' detailed energy usage patterns to other prosumers within the microgrid.
Addressing this issue in a decentralized trading platform is quite challenging as it requires hiding the identities of trade partners from each other.
In comparison, secure smart metering reveals the prosumers' energy usage patterns only to the provider. 
\item Secondly, transactions may reveal the future energy usage of a prosumer, which could be used to infer private information.
For example, a smart home may know that its inhabitants will go out in the evening (e.g., by looking at their calendar), and it may trade energy futures accordingly in the morning.
Without adequate privacy measures, these trades may reveal to other prosumers in the microgrid that the inhabitants will not be at home later.
Note that energy futures, whose delivery may happen several hours after when the transaction is made, can play a very important role in predicting and controlling microgrid load.
In comparison, smart metering reveals only current (and past) usage.
\item Thirdly, transactions and energy usage data in a transactive microgrid are much richer source of information than the simple energy usage data collected by smart meters.
More specifically, the information available in a transactive microgrid is a superset of what is available from smart metering, and it may be used to infer personal information, such as risk propensity and financial standing.
\end{itemize}

We propose a solution that enables trading energy futures in a secure and verifiable manner, preserves the prosumers' privacy, enables the DSO to regulate the trading platform and enforce certain safety rules.
