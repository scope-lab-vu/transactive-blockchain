This repository simulates attacks that delay (or drop) bids. We implement the attack in two ways. First, we simulate the market using an auction in GridLAB-D:

make -s -f Makefile.attack simulate_nominal


Sencond, we use an external function to simulate the market:

make -s -f Makefile.attack simulate_nominal_ext

We define events in 'events_attack/events_att_nominal_ext' that write the bids in an external file and call a function that returns the market's equilibrium price. The file 'ext_functions.py' contains the functions of the external file.


The file 'bids_header.csv' has some headers needed to record the bids in GridLAB-D's format.

The file 'functions_auction.py' has functions to calculate the market's equilibrium price form a file with bids.

'config_model_att.py' is the script that we use to configure thee GLM model for this experiment.

'Makefile.attack' has the rules to make the simulations.
