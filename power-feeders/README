Scripts designed to simulate distribution system with GridLAB-D.



1) Description of the files

The folder 'taxonomy_feeders' contains some distribution feeder models that include commercial and residential loads. The folder also contains files to configure the weather and the behavior of loads. The models are provided by the GridLAB-D team at https://github.com/gridlab-d/Taxonomy_Feeders

The available models are:

	R1_1247_3_t6; houses: 118
	R4_2500_1_t6; houses: 170
	R1_2500_1_t6; houses: 222
	R3_1247_2_t6; houses: 251
	R4_1247_2_t6; houses: 384
	GC_1247_1_t6_r2; houses: 495
	GC_1247_1_t6_r3; houses: 495
	GC_1247_1_t6_r4; houses: 495
	GC_1247_1_t6_r5; houses: 495
	GC_1247_1_t6_r6; houses: 495
	R2_1247_1_t6; houses: 558
	R1_1247_2_t6; houses: 570
	R5_1247_2_t6; houses: 579
	R4_1247_1_t6; houses: 641
	R1_1247_4_t6; houses: 793
	R3_1247_1_t6; houses: 884
	R2_1247_2_t6; houses: 898
	R2_3500_1_t6; houses: 1050
	R5_1247_4_t6; houses: 1138
	R5_1247_1_t6; houses: 1346
	R3_1247_3_t6; houses: 1405
	R2_1247_3_t6; houses: 1549
	R1_1247_1_t6; houses: 1635
	R5_1247_5_t6; houses: 1677
	R2_2500_1_t6; houses: 1825
	R5_1247_3_t6; houses: 2081
	R5_2500_1_t6; houses: 2276
	R5_3500_1_t6; houses: 2367


We modify the models for our simulations. Some of the main changes are:

	Define the simulation time
	Enable the server mode of GridLAB-D
	Configure the auction object 
	Introduce bidders that offer energy
	Adjust the controllers to allow interactions with the market
	Add recorders in some components (e.g., houses' meters)


We make these changes with the script 'config_model.py', which reads the simulation's configuration from 'parameters.py'. The script 'config_model.py' uses the class defined in 'parser_GLM.py' to manipulate the feeder models. We store the resulting models in 'modified_taxonomy'.


The file 'events_normal' defines events that occur during the execution of the simulation. The script 'event_manager.py' communicates with GridLAB-D to carry out the events. The file 'README_events' has more information about the structure of the events.


We use the script 'run_gridlab.sh' to execute GridLAB-D. We store the simulation's log in '/tmp/simulation.log'


The folder 'simulations' contains the simulation results. Some of the files are

	'bid_curve.csv', 'log_file.csv', 'market.csv': Market related files
	'meter_*.csv': load measurements from the houses' meters
	'total_power_network_node.csv': Total demand of the system
	'model.xml': System's final state


The folder 'graph-feeders' contains some scripts to plot the distribution system (the plots are stores in the folder 'simulations'). We modify the scripts available at http://emac.berkeley.edu/gridlabd/taxonomy_graphs/



2) Usage

The Makefile defines the rules to modify the models and to run the simulations.


Customize the models with 
	make custom

Run the simulations with (the simulation files are stored in 'simulations/model/normal'):
	make simulate 

Plot the distribution system's structure (the files are stored in simulations/model/plot):
	make plot

Remove all the simulation files
	make clean

Extract data from the simulations (extract data from 'hvac.csv' and 'total_power_network_node.csv' and stores it in 'data_load.cvs'):
	make extract_data
