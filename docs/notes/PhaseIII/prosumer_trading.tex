\paragraph{Bidirectional Energy Trading and Residential Load Scheduling with Electric Vehicles in the Smart Grid} (2013)
\cite{kim2013bidirectional} \\
\url{http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6547831} \\
\url{http://medianetlab.ee.ucla.edu/papers/Kim&Ren&vdS&Lee-BidirectionalEnergy-JSAC-2013.pdf}
\begin{itemize}
\item ``electricity load scheduling algorithms which jointly consider load scheduling for appliances and energy trading using electric vehicles''
\item customers: determine how much energy to purchase from or to sell to the aggregator, considering the load demands of their residential appliances and the associated electricity bill
\item approaches
\begin{itemize}
\item collaborative: optimal distributed load scheduling algorithm that maximizes the social welfare of the power system
\item non-collaborative: model the energy scheduling problem as a non-cooperative game among self-interested customers
\end{itemize}
\item impact of uncertainty: consider worst-case-uncertainty approach and develop distributed load scheduling algorithms that provide the guaranteed minimum performances in uncertain environments
\item ``energy trading leads to an increase in the social welfare''
\item customer incentives for participation
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Demand Side Management in Smart Grids Using a Repeated Game Framework} (2014)
\cite{song2014demand} \\
\url{http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6840289}
\url{http://www.seas.ucla.edu/~linqi/smartgrids.pdf}
\begin{itemize}
\item ``model the interaction emerging among self-interested and foresighted consumers as a repeated energy scheduling game and prove that the stationary strategies are suboptimal in terms of long-term total billing and discomfort costs''
\item ``novel framework for determining optimal nonstationary demand-side management strategies, in which consumers can choose different daily power consumption patterns depending on their preferences, routines, and needs''
\item incentive compatible strategies
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Optimal Residential Load Control with Price Prediction in Real-Time Electricity Pricing Environments} (2010)
\cite{mohsenian2010optimal} \\
\url{http://www.ee.ucr.edu/~hamed/MRLGjTSG10.pdf}
\begin{itemize}
\item ``lack of knowledge among users about how to respond to time-varying prices as well as the lack of effective building automation systems are two major barriers for fully utilizing the potential benefits of real-time pricing tariffs''
\item optimal and automatic residential energy consumption scheduling based on simple linear programming computations
\item ``residential load control strategy in real-time electricity pricing environments requires price prediction capabilities'' (especially if ``utility companies provide price information only one or two hours ahead of time'')
\item weighted average price prediction
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Appliance Commitment for Household Load Scheduling} (2011)
\cite{du2011appliance} \\
\url{https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ning_Lu4/publication/220592828_Appliance_Commitment_for_House_Hold_Load_Scheduling/links/53fdeb450cf2dca80003abf0.pdf}
\begin{itemize}
\item ``appliance commitment algorithm that schedules thermostatically controlled household loads based on price and consumption forecasts considering usersâ€™ comfort settings to meet an optimization objective such as minimum payment or maximum comfort''
\item two-step adjustment process: day-ahead scheduling and real-time adjustment
\item example: electrical water heater, whose thermal dynamics are modeled with physical methods
\item random hot water consumption: modeled with statistical methods
\item user comfort: set of linear constraints
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Scheduling Power Consumption With Price Uncertainty} (2011)
\cite{kim2011scheduling} \\
\url{http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5959241/}
\begin{itemize}
\item ``scheduling power consumption to minimize the expected cost at the consumer side''
\item scheduling problem: find decision thresholds for a Markov decision process (for both noninterruptible and interruptible loads under a deadline constraint)
\item incorporating the statistical knowledge about future prices into the scheduling policies can result in significant savings
\end{itemize}
