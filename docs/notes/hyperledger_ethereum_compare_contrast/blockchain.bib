  abstract     = {The emerging Fog Computing paradigm provides an additional computational layer that enables new capabilities in real-time data-driven applications. This is especially interesting in the domain of Smart Grid as the boundaries between traditional generation, distribution, and consumer roles are blurring. This is a reflection of the ongoing trend of intelligence distribution in Smart Systems. In this paper, we briefly describe a component-based decentralized software platform called Resilient Information Architecture Platform for Smart Systems (RIAPS) which provides an infrastructure for such systems. We briefly describe some initial applications built using this platform.  Then, we focus on the design and integration choices for a resilient Discovery Manager service that is a critical component of this infrastructure. The service allows applications to discover each other, work collaboratively, and ensure the stability of the Smart System.},

is the tendency for users to “free ride”—to consume resources
without contributing to the system. The popular
file distribution tool BitTorrent was explicitly designed to
address this problem, using a tit-for-tat reciprocity strategy
to provide positive incentives for nodes to contribute
resources to the swarm. While BitTorrent has been extremely
successful, we show that its incentive mechanism
is not robust to strategic clients. Through performance
modeling parameterized by real world traces, we
demonstrate that all peers contribute resources that do
not directly improve their performance. We use these results
to drive the design and implementation of BitTyrant,
a strategic BitTorrent client that provides a median 70%
performance gain for a 1 Mbit client on live Internet
swarms. We further show that when applied universally,
strategic clients can hurt average per-swarm performance
compared to today’s BitTorrent client implementations},

  abstract   = {User privacy is an important issue in a blockchain based transaction system. Bitcoin, being one of the most widely used blockchain based transaction system, fails to provide enough protection on users' privacy. Many subsequent studies focus on establishing a system that hides the linkage between the identities (pseudonyms) of users and the transactions they carry out in order to provide a high level of anonymity. Examples include Zerocoin, Zerocash and so on. It thus becomes an interesting question whether such new transaction systems do provide enough protection on users' privacy. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective approach for de-anonymizing these transaction systems by leveraging information in the system that is not directly related, including the number of transactions made by each identity and time stamp of sending and receiving. Combining probability studies with optimization tools, we establish a model which allows us to determine, among all possible ways of linking between transactions and identities, the one that is most likely to be true. Subsequent transaction graph analysis could then be carried out, leading to the de-anonymization of the system. To solve the model, we provide exact algorithms based on mixed integer linear programming. Our research also establishes interesting relationships between the de-anonymization problem and other problems studied in the literature of theoretical computer science, e.g., the graph matching problem and scheduling problem.},

  abstract  = {As the first decentralized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin [1] has ignited much excitement, not only for its novel realization of a central bank-free financial instrument, but also as an alternative approach to classical distributed computing problems, such as reaching agreement distributedly in the presence of misbehaving parties, as well as to numerous other applications-contracts, reputation systems, name services, etc. The soundness and security of these applications, however, hinges on the thorough understanding of the fundamental properties of its underlying blockchain data structure, which parties ("miners") maintain and try to extend by generating "proofs of work" (POW, aka "cryptographic puzzle"). In this talk we follow the approach introduced in [2], formulating such fundamental properties of the blockchain, and then showing how applications such as consensus and a robust public transaction ledger can be built ``on top'' of them. The properties are as follows, assuming the adversary's hashing power (our analysis holds against arbitrary attacks) is strictly less than $\sfrac{1}{2}$ and high network synchrony: Common prefix: The blockchains maintained by the honest parties possess a large common prefix. More specifically, if two honest parties "prune" (i.e., cut off) k blocks from the end of their local chains, the probability that the resulting pruned chains will not be mutual prefixes of each other drops exponentially in the that parameter. Chain quality: We show a bound on the ratio of blocks in the chain of any honest party contributed by malicious parties. In particular, as the adversary's hashing power approaches $\sfrac{1}{2}$, we show that blockchains are only guaranteed to have few, but still some, blocks contributed by honest parties. Chain growth: We quantify the number of blocks that are added to the blockchain during any given number of rounds during the execution of the protocol. (N.B.: This property, which in [2] was proven and used directly in the form of a lemma, was explicitly introduced in [3]. Identifying it as a separate property enables modular proofs of applications' properties.) The above properties hold assuming that all parties-honest and adversarial-"wake up" and start computing at the same time, or, alternatively, that they compute on a common random string (the "genesis" block) only made available at the exact time when the protocol execution is to begin. In this talk we also consider the question of whether such a trusted setup/behavioral assumption is necessary, answering it in the negative by presenting a Bitcoin-like blockchain protocol that is provably secure without trusted setup, and, further, overcomes such lack in a scalable way-i.e., with running time independent of the number of parties [4]. A direct consequence of our construction above is that consensus can be solved directly by a blockchain protocol without trusted setup assuming an honest majority (in terms of computational power).},

  abstract  = {Proof of Work (PoW) powered blockchains currently account for more than 90% of the total market capitalization of existing digital cryptocurrencies. Although the security provisions of Bitcoin have been thoroughly analysed, the security guarantees of variant (forked) PoW blockchains (which were instantiated with different parameters) have not received much attention in the literature. This opens the question whether existing security analysis of Bitcoin's PoW applies to other implementations which have been instantiated with different consensus and/or network parameters. In this paper, we introduce a novel quantitative framework to analyse the security and performance implications of various consensus and network parameters of PoW blockchains. Based on our framework, we devise optimal adversarial strategies for double-spending and selfish mining while taking into account real world constraints such as network propagation, different block sizes, block generation intervals, information propagation mechanism, and the impact of eclipse attacks. Our framework therefore allows us to capture existing PoW-based deployments as well as PoW blockchain variants that are instantiated with different parameters, and to objectively compare the tradeoffs between their performance and security provisions.},

  abstract  = {Existing security mechanisms for managing the Internet infrastructural resources like IP addresses, AS numbers, BGP advertisements and DNS mappings rely on a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) that can be potentially compromised by state actors and Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). Ideally the Internet infrastructure needs a distributed and tamper-resistant resource management framework which cannot be subverted by any single entity. A secure, distributed ledger enables such a mechanism and the blockchain is the best known example of distributed ledgers. In this paper, we propose the use of a blockchain based mechanism to secure the Internet BGP and DNS infrastructure. While the blockchain has scaling issues to be overcome, the key advantages of such an approach include the elimination of any PKI-like root of trust, a verifiable and distributed transaction history log, multi-signature based authorizations for enhanced security, easy extensibility and scriptable programmability to secure new types of Internet resources and potential for a built in cryptocurrency. A tamper resistant DNS infrastructure also ensures that it is not possible for the application level PKI to spoof HTTPS traffic.},

  abstract  = {The blockchain emerges as an innovative tool that has the potential to positively impact the way we design a number of online applications today. In many ways, the blockchain technology is, however, still not mature enough to cater for industrial standards. Namely, existing Byzantine tolerant permission-based blockchain deployments can only scale to a limited number of nodes. These systems typically require that all transactions (and their order of execution) are publicly available to all nodes in the system, which comes at odds with common data sharing practices in the industry, and prevents a centralized regulator from overseeing the full blockchain system. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain architecture devised specifically to meet industrial standards. Our proposal leverages the notion of satellite chains that can privately run different consensus protocols in parallel - thereby considerably boosting the scalability premises of the system. Our solution also accounts for a hands-off regulator that oversees the entire network, enforces specific policies by means of smart contracts, etc. We implemented our solution and integrated it with Hyperledger Fabric v0.6.},

At the time of writing, the blockchain weights 79 GiB and takes hours of processing on high-end machines. Owners of low-resource devices (known as thin nodes), such as smart-phones, avoid that cost by either opting for minimum verification or by depending on full nodes, which weakens their security model. In this work, we propose to harden the security model of thin nodes by enabling them to verify blocks in an adaptive manner, with regards to the level of targeted confidence, with low storage requirements and a short bootstrap time. Our approach exploits sharding within a distributed hash table (DHT) to distribute the storage load, and a few additional hashes to prevent attacks on this new system.},

  abstract  = {The blockchain emerges as an innovative tool which proves to be useful in a number of application scenarios. A number of large industrial players, such as IBM, Microsoft, Intel, and NEC, are currently investing in exploiting the blockchain in order to enrich their portfolio of products. A number of researchers and practitioners speculate that the blockchain technology can change the way we see a number of online applications today. Although it is still early to tell for sure, it is expected that the blockchain will stimulate considerable changes to a large number of products and will positively impact the digital experience of many individuals around the globe. In this tutorial, we overview, detail, and analyze the security provisions of Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain-effectively capturing recently reported attacks and threats in the system. Our contributions go beyond the mere analysis of reported vulnerabilities of Bitcoin; namely, we describe and evaluate a number of countermeasures to deter threats on the system-some of which have already been incorporated in the system. Recall that Bitcoin has been forked multiple times in order to fine-tune the consensus (i.e., the block generation time and the hash function), and the network parameters (e.g., the size of blocks). As such, the results reported in this tutorial are not only restricted to Bitcoin, but equally apply to a number of "altcoins" which are basically clones/forks of the Bitcoin source code. Given the increasing number of alternative blockchain proposals, this tutorial extracts the basic security lessons learnt from the Bitcoin system with the aim to foster better designs and analysis of next-generation secure blockchain currencies and technologies.},

  abstract  = {Blockchain, an innovative public ledger of transactions that underpins digital currencies such as Bitcoin, has the potential to open up and offer radical alternatives to civic life, democracy and society. Yet there is currently only a small, technically savvy section of society who understand its principles. Therefore in order to work through and realize the potential of the blockchain and its transferability across society we need to find means to open up and reduce its 'ineffable' nature. This paper presents and reflects on an approach that made the complexity of the blockchain understandable or 'effable' using physical modeling. The design-based approach adopted a tangible system of Lego and colored stickers to allow participant-actors to physically enact transactions on a Blockchain Lego 'block'. This modeled simplification was not designed as a comprehensive or accurate explanation of Bitcoin and Blockchain but rather as a prompt for opening up rich dialogue and insightful lines of questioning.},

To reduce this asymmetry and increase the scalability of this important instrument, we propose a framework, DecReg, based on blockchain technology. We provide the protocols designed for this framework and present performance analysis. This framework will be deployed in practice as of February 2017 in the Netherlands.},

Specifically, blockchain provides a method to enforce the agreement between a user and the physical property owner without using any trusted party, e.g., if a user pays the agreed money, the blockchain guarantees that he/she has access to the property. While a blockchain based system has many desirable features, it may leak privacy information of involved parties due to its openness to the public. To mitigate the privacy concern, we propose a privacy respecting approach for blockchain-based sharing economy applications, which leverages a zero-knowledge scheme. We also analyze the security features and performance of the proposed approach to demonstrate its effectiveness in these applications.},

It's thought that encoding contracts and putting them "on the blockchain" will result in a new generation of organisations that are leaner and more efficient than their forebears ("CApps"?"), disrupting these forebears in the process. However, the most interesting aspect of Bitcoin and blockchain is that it involved no new technology, no new math. Their emergence was due to changes in the environment: the price-performance and penetration of broadband networks reached a point that it was economically viable for a decentralised solution, such as Bitcoin to compete with traditional payment (international remittance) networks. This is combining with another trend -- the shift from monolithic firms to multi-sided markets such as AirBnb et al and the rise of "platform businesses" -- to enable a new class of solution to emerge. These new solutions enable firms to interact directly, without the need for a facilitator such as a market, exchange, or even a blockchain. In the past these facilitators were firms. More recently they have been "platform businesses". In the future they may not exist at all.},

Although the conventional wisdom is to build atop a (weakly) synchronous protocol such as PBFT (or a variation thereof), such protocols rely critically on network timing assumptions, and only guarantee liveness when the network behaves as expected. We argue these protocols are ill-suited for this deployment scenario. We present an alternative, HoneyBadgerBFT, the first practical asynchronous BFT protocol, which guarantees liveness without making any timing assumptions. We base our solution on a novel atomic broadcast protocol that achieves optimal asymptotic efficiency. We present an implementation and experimental results to show our system can achieve throughput of tens of thousands of transactions per second, and scales to over a hundred nodes on a wide area network. We even conduct BFT experiments over Tor, without needing to tune any parameters. Unlike the alternatives, HoneyBadgerBFT simply does not care about the underlying network.},

However, BCs are computationally expensive and involve high bandwidth overhead and delays, which are not suitable for most IoT devices. This paper proposes a lightweight BC-based architecture for IoT that virtually eliminates the overheads of classic BC, while maintaining most of its security and privacy benefits. IoT devices benefit from a private immutable ledger, that acts similar to BC but is managed centrally, to optimize energy consumption. High resource devices create an overlay network to implement a publicly accessible distributed BC that ensures end-to-end security and privacy. The proposed architecture uses distributed trust to reduce the block validation processing time. We explore our approach in a smart home setting as a representative case study for broader IoT applications. Qualitative evaluation of the architecture under common threat models highlights its effectiveness in providing security and privacy for IoT applications. Simulations demonstrate that our method decreases packet and processing overhead significantly compared to the BC implementation used in Bitcoin.},

  abstract = {Monero is a privacy-centric cryptocurrency that allows
users to obscure their transaction graph by including chaff
coins, called “mixins,” along with the actual coins they
spend. In this report, we empirically evaluate two weaknesses
in Monero’s mixin sampling strategy. First, about
62% of transaction inputs with one or more mixins are
vulnerable to “chain-reaction” analysis — that is, the real
input can be deduced by elimination, e.g. because the
mixins they include are spent by 0-mixin transactions. Second,
Monero mixins are sampled in such a way that the
mixins can be easily distinguished from the real coins by
their age distribution; in short, the real input is usually
the “newest” input. We estimate that this heuristic can
be used to guess the real input with 80% accuracy over
all transactions with 1 or more mixins. Our analysis uses
only public blockchain data, in contrast to earlier attacks
requiring active participation in the network [10, 7]. While
the first weakness primarily affects Monero transactions
made by older software versions (i.e., prior to RingCT),
the second weakness is applicable to the newest versions
as well. We propose and evaluate a countermeasure derived
from blockchain data that can improve the privacy of
future transactions.},

  abstract  = {Distributed cryptographic ledgers, such as the blockchain, are now being used in recordkeeping. However, they lack a key feature of more traditional recordkeeping systems needed to establish the authenticity of records and enable reliance on them for trustworthy recordkeeping. The missing feature is known in archival science as the archival bond -- the mutual relationship that exists among documents by virtue of the actions in which they participate. In this paper, we propose a novel data model and syntax using core web principles that can be used to address this shortcoming in distributed ledgers as recordkeeping systems.},

The Web is as Sir Tim Berners-Lee envisioned it, a vast resource of interconnected knowledge. Yet that resource exists in a universe of its own. Meanwhile the real world has become crowded with connected devices, none more significant than the smartphone - bringing the Web to eighty percent of the planet's adult population by the end of this decade. Smartphones have become fantastically adept at navigating cyberspace, but - with the singular exception of maps - have few real connections to the world immediately at hand. In 2017 we live in two worlds: the Web, and the real. The time has come to knit these two together. To begin that integration, our first step must be a deep moment of contemplation about what the Web and the real world have to offer one another. How can each amplify the value and capacity of the other? Because of the Web, the real world is pregnant with data and knowledge - what does that world look like? How do we use it? How does it change the way we think and behave? In this simple act of design thinking - toward a "Web-wide world" - we can reframe the possibilities of what both the Web and the real world can offer - and what we can offer both. This is the next great project for the Web - finding its place in the world.},

Centralized schemes enable accountability, but leave the privacy of users' identities and transactions in the hands of one organization. Distributed schemes can ensure better privacy but provide little accountability. In this paper we design a privacy-preserving proactively-secure distributed ledger and associated transaction protocols that can be used to implement an accountable digital currency that inherits the ledger's privacy and security features. One of the main technical challenges that we address is dealing with the increase in ledger size over time, an unavoidable aspect as the currency spreads and the ledger is required to be maintained for a long time in the future. We accomplish this by reducing the distributed (secret-shared) storage footprint and the required bandwidth and computation for proactively refreshing the ledger to ensure long-term confidentiality and security. In the full version, we provide performance analysis of some of the subprotocols to estimate the time required to perform transactions and the proactive refreshing of the ledger.},

These business applications operate in environments where participants have verified identities; these are called permissioned environments. Blockchain is an immutable and append only distributed ledger that can be utilized for record keeping applications. We observe that when blockchain technology is adapted from permissionless environments to permissioned environments the immutability of blockchain becomes questionable as the end-users may not monitor or store a copy of the blockchain. We propose the use of Keyless Signatures' Infrastructure as an additional mechanism to ensure irreversible and irrefutable proof of block confirmations which acts as a global proof thus preserving long term immutability of blockchain in permissioned environments.},

Although researchers have study different representations of OLM, a broader view that situates OLM in Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) is missing. An important element in SRL that can bring a better understanding of these tools and their effects concerns to learning motivation theories. In this work I connect these aspects and propose to study the effects of OLM and motivational factors drawn from learning motivation theories. To account for a broader spectrum of OLM representations, I proposed to explore the addition of social information and different levels of granularity in the OLM. I propose to evaluate different designs and then to evaluate the resulting interface in field studies. With the proposed work I expect to gain a deeper understanding of the effects of OLM tools which can be used to guide the development of better tools, better personalization and adaptive mechanisms, better use of such tools in supporting Self-Regulated Learning, and ultimately impact positively in learning.},

  abstract   = {The Distributed Computing Column covers the theory of systems that are composed of a number of interacting computing elements. These include problems of communication and networking, databases, distributed shared memory, multiprocessor architectures, operating systems, verification, internet, and the web.This issue consists of the paper "Reconstructing Paxos" by Romain Boichat, Partha Dutta, Svend Fr{\o}lund, and Rachid Guerraoui. Many thanks to them for contributing to this issue.The celebrated Paxos algorithm of Lamport implements a fault-tolerant deterministic service by replicating it over a distributed message-passing system. In a companion paper [2], we presented a deconstruction of the algorithm by factoring out its fundamental algorithmic principles within two abstractions: an eventual leader election and an eventual register abstractions. Using those abstractions, we show in this paper how to reconstruct, in a modular manner, powerful variants of Paxos. In particular, we show how to (1) alleviate the need for stable storage access if some processes remain up for sufficiently long, (2) augment the resilience of the algorithm against unstable processes, (3) enable single process decision with shared commodity disks, and (4) reduce the number of communication steps during stable periods of the system.The Island of Paxos used to host a great civilisation which had developed a sophisticated parttime parliament protocol. Paxons codified various aspects of their parliament protocol which enabled them to easily adapt the protocol to specific functioning modes throughout the seasons. In particular, during winter, the parliament was heated and some legislators did never leave the chamber: their guaranteed presence helped alleviate the need for the writing of decrees on ledgers. This was easy to obtain precisely because the subprotocol used to "store and lock" decrees was precisely codified. In spring, and with the blooming days coming, some legislators could not stop leaving and entering the parliament. Their indiscipline prevented progress in the protocol. However, as the election subprotocol used to choose the parliament president was also precisely codified, the protocol could easily be adapted to cope with indisciplined legislators. During summer, very few legislators were in the parliament and it was hardly possible to pass any decree because of the lack of the necessary majority. Fortunately, it was easy to modify the subprotocol used to store and lock decrees and devise a powerful technique where a single legislator could pass decrees by directly accessing the ledgers of other legislators. Fall was a protest season and citizens wanted a faster procedure to pass decrees. Paxons noticed that, in most periods, messengers did not loose messages and legislators replied in time. They could devise a variant of the protocol that reduced the number of communication steps needed to pass decrees during those periods. Again, this optimisation was obtained through a simple refinement of the subprotocol used to propose new decrees.},

In this article we present a novel methodology for integrating these two protocols. Through an analysis of properties of SIP and SOAP we show that integration between these protocols should be based on application-specific converters. We describe a generic SIP/SOAP gateway that implements message handling and network and storage management while relying on application-specific converters to define session management and message mapping for a specific set of SIP and SOAP communication nodes. In order to ease development of these converters, we introduce an XML-based domain-specific language for describing application-specific conversion processes. We show how conversion processes can be easily specified in the language using message sequence diagrams of the desired interaction. We evaluate the presented methodology through performance analysis of the developed prototype gateway and high-level comparison with other solutions.},

  abstract      = {Thanks to their anonymity (pseudonymity) and elimination of trusted intermediaries, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have created or stimulated growth in many businesses and communities. Unfortunately, some of these are criminal, e.g., money laundering, illicit marketplaces, and ransomware. Next-generation cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum will include rich scripting languages in support of smart contracts, programs that autonomously intermediate transactions. In this paper, we explore the risk of smart contracts fueling new criminal ecosystems. Specifically, we show how what we call criminal smart contracts (CSCs) can facilitate leakage of confidential information, theft of cryptographic keys, and various real-world crimes (murder, arson, terrorism). We show that CSCs for leakage of secrets (a la Wikileaks) are efficiently realizable in existing scripting languages such as that in Ethereum. We show that CSCs for theft of cryptographic keys can be achieved using primitives, such as Succinct Non-interactive ARguments of Knowledge (SNARKs), that are already expressible in these languages and for which efficient supporting language extensions are anticipated. We show similarly that authenticated data feeds, an emerging feature of smart contract systems, can facilitate CSCs for real-world crimes (e.g., property crimes). Our results highlight the urgency of creating policy and technical safeguards against CSCs in order to realize the promise of smart contracts for beneficial goals.},

  abstract      = {Ethereum is a framework for cryptocurrencies which uses blockchain technology to provide an open global computing platform, called the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). EVM executes bytecode on a simple stack machine. Programmers do not usually write EVM code; instead, they can program in a JavaScript-like language, called Solidity, that compiles to bytecode. Since the main purpose of EVM is to execute smart contracts that manage and transfer digital assets (called Ether), security is of paramount importance. However, writing secure smart contracts can be extremely difficult: due to the openness of Ethereum, both programs and pseudonymous users can call into the public methods of other programs, leading to potentially dangerous compositions of trusted and untrusted code. This risk was recently illustrated by an attack on TheDAO contract that exploited subtle details of the EVM semantics to transfer roughly $50M worth of Ether into the control of an attacker. In this paper, we outline a framework to analyze and verify both the runtime safety and the functional correctness of Ethereum contracts by translation to F*, a functional programming language aimed at program verification.},

  abstract      = {Cryptocurrencies record transactions in a decentralized data structure called a blockchain. Two of the most popular cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, support the feature to encode rules or scripts for processing transactions. This feature has evolved to give practical shape to the ideas of smart contracts, or full-fledged programs that are run on blockchains. Recently, Ethereum's smart contract system has seen steady adoption, supporting tens of thousands of contracts, holding millions dollars worth of virtual coins. In this paper, we investigate the security of running smart contracts based on Ethereum in an open distributed network like those of cryptocurrencies. We introduce several new security problems in which an adversary can manipulate smart contract execution to gain profit. These bugs suggest subtle gaps in the understanding of the distributed semantics of the underlying platform. As a refinement, we propose ways to enhance the operational semantics of Ethereum to make contracts less vulnerable. For developers writing contracts for the existing Ethereum system, we build a symbolic execution tool called Oyente to find potential security bugs. Among 19, 336 existing Ethereum contracts, Oyente flags 8, 833 of them as vulnerable, including the TheDAO bug which led to a 60 million US dollar loss in June 2016. We also discuss the severity of other attacks for several case studies which have source code available and confirm the attacks (which target only our accounts) in the main Ethereum network.},

In this work, we analyze the extent to which these systems can enforce the correct semantics of scripts. We show that when a script execution requires nontrivial computation effort, practical attacks exist which either waste miners' computational resources or lead miners to accept incorrect script results. These attacks drive miners to an ill-fated choice, which we call the verifier's dilemma, whereby rational miners are well-incentivized to accept unvalidated blockchains. We call the framework of computation through a scriptable cryptocurrency a consensus computer and develop a model that captures incentives for verifying computation in it. We propose a resolution to the verifier's dilemma which incentivizes correct execution of certain applications, including outsourced computation, where scripts require minimal time to verify. Finally we discuss two distinct, practical implementations of our consensus computer in real cryptocurrency networks like Ethereum.},

However, popular sharing platforms like Airbnb or Uber exhibit several drawbacks: a cumbersome sign up procedure, lack of participant privacy, overbearing terms and conditions, and significant fees for users. We demonstrate a Decentralised App (DAPP) for the sharing of everyday objects based on a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract enables users to register and rent devices without involvement of a Trusted Third Party (TTP), disclosure of any personal information or prior sign up to the service. With increasing distribution of cryptocurrencies the use of smart contracts such as proposed in this paper has the potential to revolutionise the sharing economy.},

Their key envisioned uses (e.g. financial instruments) require them to consume data from outside the blockchain (e.g. stock quotes). Trustworthy data feeds that support a broad range of data requests will thus be critical to smart contract ecosystems. We present an authenticated data feed system called Town Crier (TC). TC acts as a bridge between smart contracts and existing web sites, which are already commonly trusted for non-blockchain applications. It combines a blockchain front end with a trusted hardware back end to scrape HTTPS-enabled websites and serve source-authenticated data to relying smart contracts. TC also supports confidentiality. It enables private data requests with encrypted parameters. Additionally, in a generalization that executes smart-contract logic within TC, the system permits secure use of user credentials to scrape access-controlled online data sources. We describe TC's design principles and architecture and report on an implementation that uses Intel's recently introduced Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to furnish data to the Ethereum smart contract system. We formally model TC and define and prove its basic security properties in the Universal Composibility (UC) framework. Our results include definitions and techniques of general interest relating to resource consumption (Ethereum's "gas" fee system) and TCB minimization. We also report on experiments with three example applications. We plan to launch TC soon as an online public service.},

  abstract      = {Blockchain technologies are taking the world by storm. Public blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, enable secure peer-to-peer applications like crypto-currency or smart contracts. Their security and performance are well studied. This paper concerns recent private blockchain systems designed with stronger security (trust) assumption and performance requirement. These systems target and aim to disrupt applications which have so far been implemented on top of database systems, for example banking, finance and trading applications. Multiple platforms for private blockchains are being actively developed and fine tuned. However, there is a clear lack of a systematic framework with which different systems can be analyzed and compared against each other. Such a framework can be used to assess blockchains' viability as another distributed data processing platform, while helping developers to identify bottlenecks and accordingly improve their platforms. In this paper, we first describe BLOCKBENCH, the first evaluation framework for analyzing private blockchains. It serves as a fair means of comparison for different platforms and enables deeper understanding of different system design choices. Any private blockchain can be integrated to BLOCKBENCH via simple APIs and benchmarked against workloads that are based on real and synthetic smart contracts. BLOCKBENCH measures overall and component-wise performance in terms of throughput, latency, scalability and fault-tolerance. Next, we use BLOCKBENCH to conduct comprehensive evaluation of three major private blockchains: Ethereum, Parity and Hyperledger Fabric. The results demonstrate that these systems are still far from displacing current database systems in traditional data processing workloads. Furthermore, there are gaps in performance among the three systems which are attributed to the design choices at different layers of the blockchain's software stack. We have released BLOCKBENCH for public use.},

In the past there has been instances of certificate authorities publishing rogue certificates for targeted attacks, and this has been difficult to immediately detect as certificate authorities are not transparent about the certificates they issue. Furthermore, the centralised selection of trusted certificate authorities by operating system and browser vendors means that it is not practical to untrust certificate authorities that have issued rogue certificates, as this would disrupt the TLS process for many other hosts. SCPKI is an alternative PKI system based on a decentralised and transparent design using a web-of-trust model and a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, to make it easily possible for rogue certificates to be detected when they are published. The web-of-trust model is designed such that an entity or authority in the system can verify (or vouch for) fine-grained attributes of another entity's identity (such as company name or domain name), as an alternative to the centralised certificate authority identity verification model.},
