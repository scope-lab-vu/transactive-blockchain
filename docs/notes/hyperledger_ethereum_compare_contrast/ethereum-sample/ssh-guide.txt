# copy blockchain.private to your ~/.ssh directory 
# this version is usable with ssh in linux, the .ppk version is usable via putty in windows.

# add the following to ~/.ssh/config to connect to the blockchain cnc machine via 'ssh blockchain' 
# (can name it whatever you want)

host blockchain
   Hostname 129.59.107.34
   User ubuntu
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/blockchain.private
   IdentitiesOnly yes
   Port 22



# Once connected the blockchain-cnc machine already has the ssh key to connect to every other machine
# It also has tmux installed and a session running
# Though feel free to kill that session if you want, since window #1 is frozen, so 0 is eth1, rest are eth# for window

# great tmux cheatsheet https://gist.github.com/MohamedAlaa/2961058
