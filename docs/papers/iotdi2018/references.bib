Specifically, blockchain provides a method to enforce the agreement between a user and the physical property owner without using any trusted party, e.g., if a user pays the agreed money, the blockchain guarantees that he/she has access to the property. While a blockchain based system has many desirable features, it may leak privacy information of involved parties due to its openness to the public. To mitigate the privacy concern, we propose a privacy respecting approach for blockchain-based sharing economy applications, which leverages a zero-knowledge scheme. We also analyze the security features and performance of the proposed approach to demonstrate its effectiveness in these applications.},

Such distributed applications require the execution of reliable and accurate time-coordinated actions and observations both within islands of deployments and across geographically distant nodes. The time synchronization infrastructure is built on well-established technologies: GPS, NTP, PTP, PPS and Linux with real-time extensions, running on low-cost BeagleBone Black hardware nodes. We describe the architecture, implementation, instrumentation approach, performance results and present an example from the application domain. Also, we discuss an important finding on the effect of the Linux \texttt{RT\_PREEMPT} real-time patch on the accuracy of the PPS subsystem and its use for GPS-based time reference},
