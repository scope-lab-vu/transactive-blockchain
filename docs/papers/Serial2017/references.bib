Specifically, blockchain provides a method to enforce the agreement between a user and the physical property owner without using any trusted party, e.g., if a user pays the agreed money, the blockchain guarantees that he/she has access to the property. While a blockchain based system has many desirable features, it may leak privacy information of involved parties due to its openness to the public. To mitigate the privacy concern, we propose a privacy respecting approach for blockchain-based sharing economy applications, which leverages a zero-knowledge scheme. We also analyze the security features and performance of the proposed approach to demonstrate its effectiveness in these applications.},

Timing attacks are a significant challenge for mix-based systems that wish to support interactive, low-latency applications. However, the potency of these attacks has not been studied carefully. In this paper, we investigate timing analysis attacks on low-latency mix systems and clarify the threat they pose. We propose a novel technique, defensive dropping, to thwart timing attacks. Through simulations and analysis, we show that defensive dropping can be effective against attackers who employ timing analysis.",

abstract="The ring signature allows a signer to leak secrets anonymously, without the risk of identity escrow. At the same time, the ring signature provides great flexibility: No group manager, no special setup, and the dynamics of group choice. The ring signature is, however, vulnerable to malicious or irresponsible signers in some applications, because of its anonymity. In this paper, we propose a traceable ring signature scheme. A traceable ring scheme is a ring signature except that it can restrict ``excessive'' anonymity. The traceable ring signature has a tag that consists of a list of ring members and an issue that refers to, for instance, a social affair or an election. A ring member can make any signed but anonymous opinion regarding the issue, but only once (per tag). If the member submits another signed opinion, possibly pretending to be another person who supports the first opinion, the identity of the member is immediately revealed. If the member submits the same opinion, for instance, voting ``yes'' regarding the same issue twice, everyone can see that these two are linked. The traceable ring signature can suit to many applications, such as an anonymous voting on a BBS. We formalize the security definitions for this primitive and show an efficient and simple construction in the random oracle model.",

abstract="I2P is one of the most widely used anonymizing Peer-to-Peer networks on the Internet today. Like Tor, it uses onion routing to build tunnels between peers as the basis for providing anonymous communication channels. Unlike Tor, I2P integrates a range of anonymously hosted services directly with the platform. This paper presents a new attack on the I2P Peer-to-Peer network, with the goal of determining the identity of peers that are anonymously hosting HTTP services (Eepsite) in the network.",

abstract="Anonymity networks, such as Tor or I2P, were built to allow users to access network resources without revealing their identity. Newer designs, like I2P, run in a completely decentralized fashion, while older systems, like Tor, are built around central authorities. The decentralized approach has advantages (no trusted central party, better scalability), but there are also security risks associated with the use of distributed hash tables (DHTs) in this environment.",

abstract="Anonymity in Bitcoin, a peer-to-peer electronic currency system, is a complicated issue. Within the system, users are identified only by public-keys. An attacker wishing to de-anonymize users will attempt to construct the one-to-many mapping between users and public-keys, and associate information external to the system with the users. Bitcoin tries to prevent this attack by storing the mapping of a user to his or her public-keys on that user's node only and by allowing each user to generate as many public-keys as required. In this chapter we consider the topological structure of two networks derived from Bitcoin's public transaction history. We show that the two networks have a non-trivial topological structure, provide complementary views of the Bitcoin system, and have implications for anonymity. We combine these structures with external information and techniques such as context discovery and flow analysis to investigate an alleged theft of Bitcoins, which, at the time of the theft, had a market value of approximately US{\$}500,000.",

abstract="In this paper we formalize the notion of a ring signature, which makes it possible to specify a set of possible signers without revealing which member actually produced the signature.Unlike group signatures, ring signatures have no group managers, no setup procedures, no revocation procedures, and no coordination:any user can choose any set of possible signers that includes himself,and sign any message by using his secret key and the others' public keys,without getting their approval or assistance. Ring signatures provide an elegant way to leak authoritativ secrets in an anonymous way, to sign casual email in a way which can only be verified by its intended recipient, and to solve other problems in multiparty computations. The main contribution of this paper is a new construction of such signatures which is unconditionally signer-ambiguous, provably secure in the random oracle model,and exceptionally efficient:adding each ring member increases the cost of signing or verifying by a single modular multiplication and a single symmetric encryption.",

abstract="We present a new public-key signature scheme and a corresponding authentication scheme that are based on discrete logarithms in a subgroup of units in ℤ                  p                 where p is a sufficiently large prime, e.g., p ≥ 2512. A key idea is to use for the base of the discrete logarithm an integer $\alpha$ in ℤ                  p                 such that the order of $\alpha$ is a sufficiently large prime q, e.g., q ≥ 2140. In this way we improve the ElGamal signature scheme in the speed of the procedures for the generation and the verification of signatures and also in the bit length of signatures. We present an efficient algorithm that preprocesses the exponentiation of a random residue modulo p.",
