% \section{Concluding Remarks}
% \label{sec:concl}
% \Aron{Since we don't have 1) space 2) much to say here, I think that we should merge this with the discussion.}
% In this paper we've built upon previous work on PETra and extended the security and anonymity aspects by investigating two crucial layers: communication and transaction anonymity. 
%
%
%As the complexity of power systems increases due to the evolution of
%power grids, decentralized transactive-energy IoT systems are emerging
%to tackle this complexity. Ironically, these decentralized systems
%also give rise to new privacy challenges, such as the potential leakage of energy usage patterns, including the possibility of inferring the future state of a prosumer.
%These challenges are exacerbated by the stringent safety and
%security requirements of power systems.
%
%This paper describes 
%\emph{Privacy-preserving Energy Transactions} (PETra), our
%innovative solution for anonymous energy trading within a transactive
%microgrid.  PETra builds on distributed ledgers, such as blockchains,
%and proven techniques for anonymity, such as mixing services and onion
%routing.  We described the workflow of anonymous energy trading and
%explained the novel transactions and services used in PETra.  Finally,
%we discussed how PETra satisfies security, safety, and privacy
%requirements.  In future work, we will provide rigorous proofs of
%satisfying these requirements.
%% and we will present an implementation
%%of PETra with performance results.
