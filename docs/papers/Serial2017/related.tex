% \section{Related Work}
% \label{sec:related}

% %In this section we describe the related research. It has been divided into two subsections to focus on blockchains, which we are using to implement the distributed ledger service described earlier, and other works on smart grid privacy concerns. 

% %\subsection{Smart Grid and Meter Privacy}
% % http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5054916/
% %McDaniel and McLaughlin discuss privacy challenges in smart grids~\cite{mcdaniel2009security}.

% New privacy concerns arise with the continuing adoption of smart
% grids. In addition to old and new security threats (such as energy
% theft and smart-meter malware), McDaniel and McLaughlin discuss the
% privacy concerns of energy usage profiling that smart grids could
% potentially enable~\cite{mcdaniel2009security}. Several approaches
% have been investigated as potential means to provide privacy
% protections for smart grid users. E.g. \cite{rajagopalan2011smart,sankar2013smart}~\cite{efthymiou2010smart}~\cite{varodayan2011smart}

% Tan et al.\ study privacy in a smart metering system from an information theoretic perspective in the presence of energy harvesting and storage units~\cite{tan2013increasing}. They show that energy harvesting provides increased privacy by diversifying the energy source, while a storage device can be used to increase both energy efficiency and privacy.  PETra extends this work by leveraging a decentralized IoT system for transactive energy and addressing the novel privacy threat posed by trading. In particular, while earlier work protected the prosumers' privacy from the DSO, PETra also protects it from other prosumers, as well as outside attackers.  A key element of PETra is its ability to distribute , manage and store  information among peers via blockchains.  As blockchain technology develops and matures, new frameworks, services, and protocols are being developed to leverage the distributed ledgers provided by blockchains.

% % They show that there exists a trade-off between the information
% % leakage rate and the wasted energy rate, and study the impact of the
% % energy harvesting rate and the size of the storage device on this trade-off.

% %Bitcoin Lightning Network is
% %decentralized system, in which transactions are sent over a network of
% %micropayment channels, whose transfer of value occurs
% %off-blockchain~\cite{poon2016bitcoin}.

% \subsection{Blockchains as Distributed Ledgers}

% As Blockchain technology continues to develop and mature, new
% frameworks, services, and protocols are being developed to leverage
% blockchain's distributed ledger. Microsoft offers Blockchain as a
% Service (BaaS) on Azure. Additionally, Microsoft has Project Bletchley
% as its architectural approach to building an Enterprise Consortium
% Blockchain Ecosystem, introducing two new concepts: blockchain
% middleware and a secure means for calling code or data outside a
% SmartContract or blockchain called
% cryptlets~\cite{gray2016introducing}. Hyperledger Fabric is a platform
% for distributed ledger solutions, which was designed to support
% pluggable implementations of different
% components~\cite{hyperledger2017fabric}. Bitcoin Lightning Network is
% decentralized system, in which transactions are sent over a network of
% micropayment channels whose transfer of value occurs
% off-blockchain~\cite{poon2016bitcoin}. Interledger is a protocol for
% payments across payment systems, which enables anyone with accounts on
% two ledgers to create a connection between
% them~\cite{thomas_protocol}. Xu et al.\ discuss the use of two pools
% of proxy agents, an agreement pool and a payment pool, to assist in
% protection of privacy when using blockchain technologies for
% transactions on tangible goods~\cite{Xu2017}.  \fi
